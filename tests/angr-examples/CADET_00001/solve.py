'''
CADET_00001 is one of the challenge released by DARPA for the Cyber Grand Challenge:
https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/samples/tree/master/examples/CADET_00001

The binary can run in the DECREE VM (http://repo.cybergrandchallenge.com/boxes/)

CADET_00001.adapted (by Jacopo Corbetta) is the same program, modified to be runnable in an Intel x86 Linux machine.

The binary contains an easter egg and a stack buffer overflow.
